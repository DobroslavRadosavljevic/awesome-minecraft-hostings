### Categories

Providers should be placed in the most appropriate category:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Hosting Providers** | Minecraft server hosting providers for all needs and budgets |
| **Self-Hosted Solutions** | Panel software and VPS providers for self-hosting |
| **Related Services** | DDoS protection, domain & DNS, backup services |

If a provider fits multiple categories, choose the most relevant one.

1. **Accurate pricing** - Verify current starting price on provider's website
